Extension files should be copied to the EDB Postgres shared directory.
This can be simply accomplished by running `make install` as root,
however the makefile does expect pg_config to be available in the
path. e.g.

$ sudo PATH=$PATH:/usr/ppas-9.5/bin make install

Once this is complete, the extension is available with `CREATE
EXTENSION edb_foreignkeyconstraintmanager;` from psql.
